# pokemon_friendshipbot
This bot will max your pokemon friendship for you. More about it on the readme file

# Working

  It works very simply. The bot will first press the space key (in some emulators, the space key makes the speed of the emulation go faster, so the bot can work faster), then it will wait 10 seconds (enough time for you to give one left click on your emulator tab so it will start receiving the commands) and finally it will walk your character just enough so the pokémon that is leading your party can max their friendship. It can also be used to hatch eggs. The emulator might present some weird behavior by the time the program ends because of those inputs, but you just need to save the game, close it and come back. This bot is made for people who want to play their games but don't have enough time or patience to max pokémon friendship.

# Disclaimer 

  You can change the values inside the code to fit your needs. It is set to use the arrow keys and do an exact number of inputs, all of which you are fre to change.
  I think you need to have pynput installed to run it, but I'm not sure, gonna check that later. Also think I might make a C version of this just for the fun of it and put it here too because python is slower
